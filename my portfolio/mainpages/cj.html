    <p> About Me</p>
    I am a self-taught front-end developer of 7 months.<br>
    I first heard about developing when I was in high school and recently took an online course on it.
    I like working on tech related projects and enjoy the ability to be creative through web design.
    Some of my hobbies are playing sports, working on my car & playing video games. I'd describe myself as an ambitious person,
    someone who's not scared of a challenge.
